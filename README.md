# PM2.5-exposure-analysis
This repository contains an analysis of how acute high-dose and repeated low-dose PM2.5 exposure produce different cellular responses in human bronchial epithelial cells.
This analysis is an interpretative synthesis the research article “Exposure scenario: Another important factor determining the toxic effects of PM2.5 and possible mechanisms involved” (Zhou et al., Environmental Pollution, 2017). 
Key mechanisms discussed:
- ROS dynamics
- Autophagy initiation vs autophagic flux
- Mitochondrial biogenesis and ATP depletion
- ER stress and unfolded protein response (UPR)
- Epigenetic regulation (DNMTs, SIRT1)
- Inflammation (IL-6)
